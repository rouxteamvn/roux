# POV = Point Of View. Cube notations has two POVs.
#
# Seen from the cube, U is always up, and there are only six kinds of moves: B, R, D, F, L, and U.
# Seen from the hands of a human, more moves exist (x, y, x, M, E, S, etc), and after a z2 move,
# U seen from the cube is D seen from the hands.
#
# This class keeps track of and maps between these POVs
